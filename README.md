HomelessTracker
===============

Hackathon Code

Simple Application to allow people to report sightings of homeless in their local area using location services.

Data is aggregated into a heatmap so that authorities can identify problem areas.

Users are also given the contact details of their local representative, and the ability to tweet them about the problem!
